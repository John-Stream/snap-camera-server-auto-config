## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice: anti virus & malware reports
The Windows binary file can produce a false positive by your anti virus software. This is a known problem with AutoIt binary files https://www.autoitscript.com/wiki/AutoIt_and_Malware

If you feel unsafe just go with the .au3 script file and run it yourself with [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/), you don't need the binary file.
